        <h1>Thank you for participating in the our survey</h1>
        <p>If you qualify and finish the survey we will send a $2 donation to a selected charity,
            up to a total of $10,0000 in 2016. If we exceed $10,000, the donation amount will instead be calculated
            based on the percentage of customers selecting any given charity listed at the end of the questionaire.
            For example, if 20% of those who complete the survey vote for a certain charity, then we will donate $2,000
            ($10,0000 x 20%) to that charity in 2015.
        </p>
